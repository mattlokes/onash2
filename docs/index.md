Welcome, My recent Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/juqaqa/designed_and_3d_printed_a_home_servernas/) exploded with overwhelming postive comments and requests for documentation on my 3D printed NAS project, so here it is!

This document is in no means fully exhaustive, but hopefully give some idea/pointers of what's required to recreate. If you have any further questions please feel free to send me issues via the github [repo](https://github.com/mattlokes/onash2). I will do my best to answer :)
